D-LMBmap can achieve automated axon segmentation from small cubes to whole brain.


## Data Preparation and Whole brain Axon Segmentation
Before training a whole-brain axon segmentation model, you need to preprocess your data in the way we recommend.And you can use your own, or one of our supplied pre-trained models for whole-brain axon segmentation.

We provide a more flexible and fast whole brain segmentation script, 
refer to the [Toolbox](https://github.com/lmbneuron/D-LMBmap/blob/main/Axon%20Segmentation/Data%20Preparation%20and%20Axon%20Segmentation/Toolbox.ipynb).

## Training the Axon Segmentation Model
After completing our suggested data preparation pipeline, refer to [Model Training](https://github.com/lmbneuron/D-LMBmap/tree/main/Axon%20Segmentation/Axon%20segmentation%20model%20training) and proceed to use your own data to train an axon segmentation model.
